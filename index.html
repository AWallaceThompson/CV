  <h3>About Me</h3>
   Hello and welcome to my first hand-coded site. As a budding IT profesional, my curiosity and love of all things tech gives <br>

   and virtualization among other interests, I look forward to growing as an IT prfessional. Feel free to look around and contact me <br>
   if I can be of help. I would be happy to help you with your technology-related needs.
